## Juvenile Salmo Salar 
![](http://www.ejpau.media.pl/articles/volume15/issue1/art-02_1.jpg)

#### Load in the data + clean it:
- Three species of fish
- The fish growth (g/day) for different concentrations of protein feed (kcal/pellet)

```{r}
fish_growth <- read_csv(here("data","fish_growth.csv"))

# use janitor() and clean up the names
fish <- fish_growth %>% clean_names()
```

QUESTION (1): Is the relationship of fish growth to protein concentration in the feed the same for each species?

- If the relationship of fish growth to protein concentration in the feed is NOT the same for each species ...

QUESTION (2): What is the formula to predict the average growth for different concentrations of protein for each species. 


NOTE: 
- use multiple linear regression 
- the starting mass:
      - 300 g for juvenile Salmo salar
      - 300 g for Oncorhynchus mykiss
      - 150 g for juvenile Oreochromis niloticus
- the fish were monitored in individual 25 liter holding tanks with flow through water systems for 7 days
- all fish survived the study except one (the Salmo salar individual fed a zero protein diet died after 4 days)


Scatterplot of the data
```{r fish_1, fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure 1. Scatterplot of the relationship between each species' amount of protein received and their growth"}

fish_scatter <- ggplot(fish, aes(x = protein, y = growth, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Protein (kcal/pellet)", y = "Growth (g/day)") +
  
  theme_minimal() 

fish_scatter
```

### Aside about correlation
#### Pearson, most common
- looking at correlation between height and volume of trees
- is the correlation different than zero
- "0" means that volume is not related to height at all
- "1" perfectly positively correlated
- "-1" perfectly negatively correlated

```{r, results=TRUE}
fish$protein <- as.numeric(fish$protein)
fish$growth <- as.numeric(fish$growth)
summary(fish)

cor.test(fish$protein, fish$growth, method = "pearson")
```
